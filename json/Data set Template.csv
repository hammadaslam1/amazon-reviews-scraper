Storage: 1 slip pocket on the back, 2 compartments, 1 inner zip slip pocket in the outermost compartment.

I wish the outer slip pocket had a magnet. When I stick my phone in there, the top tends to gape a little.

Other than that, this is a great sized purse for all the basics. Keys, phone, wallet, spf, spf lip balm, hair claw, alcohol gel, spf driving gloves, sunnies, feminine products, mace or other personal protection item, snacks, and travel tissues.

This bread maker was advertised at an excellent price, was delivered in a flash!

It's wonderfully compact (perfect small footprint on my counter) and has an attractive stainless steal design! It includes a fairly extensive recipe booklet /user manual. I unpacked it, read the directions, and was able to quickly bake my first loaf, using the cinnamon swirl bread recipe. This machine was quite user friendly, very easy to operate; literally, I just closed it and pressed four buttons after I put the ingredients into the bread pan.

The lid window and light button features allow you to view the baking process all along the way.

Amazingly, I decided to get adventurous, by adding some raisins and cranberries to the recipe, which required taking the dough out of the machine after the first kneading, then putting it back in to continue baking! I really felt like I had no idea if I was doing it correctly, because I got a bit confused by the machine's paddle removal beeps; but the LCD screen was flashing the words ""Add In"",
so I kept going. I successfully muddled through, because in the end the bread turned out so well! It smelled and tasted so wonderful; the family just loved it! I can't wait to make my next loaf.

Cuisinart has made a great little bread maker...highly recommend!",33,,TRUE

It is super compact, super durable, super simple, and it costs as much as a fast food meal. It is the most sold non smart watch ever. If you need a watch and don’t need it to connect to your phone, there is literally no reason to buy any other watch, unless you are one of those weirdos that are obsessed with how watches look. It is also super intuitive and easy to use, and the alarm function works great as well. It has 7 years of battery life, which, at a $20 price point is less than one cent per day to always know the time, have a stopwatch, and have an alarm. At night, the light works great, and during the day, it is easily readable. I’ve already bought this watch twice, and I just got it again for an upcoming trip where I won’t have my phone. However, I’ve realized that having a watch is just better. Instead of fishing around in your pocket and getting sucked into YouTube, you can just glance at your wrist. Smart watches are dumb and gimmicky. Dumb watches are the way to go, and this is the best dumb watch out there.

I have had it for 6 months now and it looks just as good as it did at first. If you are between sizes (I am 5’9” 190lbs and I am in between large and medium generally) I would recommend sizing down it is mostly personal preference on how baggy you want it, however, even though I sized down it is still quite baggy. This hoodie can be worn comfortably for >1 hour in 30 degrees, but is surprisingly not too hot indoors. I wear this during the school day almost ever day and I am comfortable walking from my car to the school doors in 10-20 degree weather, and never feel too hot while inside.

When I first unfolded one, my first impression was the size must have been wrong, as these socks looked almost like kid’s socks. The listed size is 8 - 11 on the ad, as well as on the box. I tried it on and it did stretch to fit my 7/12-8 , narrow, ladies feet. A bit tight, and length smidge too short, though. The fabric felt soft. A little gel like strip at the heel to keep the sock up. Problems: The toe area, above the seam, is cut very narrow - sloped on each side. This creates a constricted, tight feeling for my toes. I tried stretching the sock (widen), helped only a little to give more room. However, the sock is basically just way too narrow up top. People with wider feet will probably find the fit too cramped for their toes. I do not see a size larger than 8-11, either. Another issue, is the socks are frayed on the inside, in the middle, from the type of stitching, creating a fuzzy feeling. Had high hopes for these shorties.

I wanted a maternity gown for the hospital because I heard how uncomfortable and scratchy the materials of the hospital provided gowns were.

It’s flowy and is so buttery soft. The colour isn’t fun or anything but it serves a good purpose. It wasn’t see through at all even though it’s a little thin and the snaps open up a so much you can have your whole chest open for easy skin to skin and nursing right when baby is born.
I even continued to use mine after we went home. It was so hard wearing trousers with all the heavy pads and adult diapers and cooling pads with tucks and what not. The gown removed having to deal with putting trousers on and taking them off. It was also so easy to just wake up and pull front down so baby could nurse and I’d just snap them back up with my eyes closed once she was done. I still have this hanging in my closet and will definitely be using it for my next baby. The material didn’t stain at all from my baby’s birth so I won’t need to get a new one.

Closure typeHook and Eye",4.3,53341, Lisa,AEQXGIGER6GOTST733AZIV2NXP4Q,"I'm gonna do the LONG version. Bear with me. I am an obese, middle aged woman with a slew of health issues that make everything more difficult. I had a breast reduction almost 10 years ago, and assumed I went from a 44 DD - DDD to a 44 large B or small C. My most recent detailed measurements from ABraThatFits subreddit, coupled with research around the web suggests otherwise! According to my new calculations I am a 48 - 52 D - H ??? My actual under bust measurement (sitting) is 46.5"". I sit most of the time and am disabled... Criss Cross applesauce is my most comfortable position, so I took my measurements sitting like that for maximum comfort. After my reduction surgery, I decided I was done with underwires forever, and bought a bunch of Bali bras in 42C. I still have all those bras, but the back would always slide up, and the molded cups would look weird if I moved a certain way and the girls and the bra weren't moving together, so there were empty air pockets half deflated now and then. WEIRD! They were otherwise comfortable, but snagged and pilled a ton, and aren't so comfortable anymore. Here are my issues with almost ALL bras (and underwear and clothes in general) - they're almost all synthetic materials (polyester, nylon, polyamide, elastane, etc) and I have hyperhidrosis (excessively sweaty all the time, and all over my body), and eczema (since infancy), fibromyalgia, and several autoimmune disorders. Synthetic fabrics don't breathe, so I sweat worse wearing them, which 1. Stinks no matter how clean I am and 2. Causes intertrigo (yeast in skin folds) under the girls and other places. It's become such a battle that about 5 years ago, I gave up on bras completely! I'd only put one on if we were visiting family or friends, and that's it. I'd come home, whip it off, and have deep red-purple marks where the band dug in, even though the back rode up constantly. OUCH! Well, with no bra, the pressure pain and redness was gone completely, but the intertrigo stayed the same from constant skin on skin contact. And the skin got thinner, and shinier, and pinker, and now my reduction scars are becoming thick in spots! So whenever I'd feel a bit sweaty, or feel the chafing beginning, I'd tuck my cotton, modal or bamboo shirts up under the girls!!! But that's not a long term solution, and can't be done out of the house. LOL

Two weeks ago I began trying to find bras or bralette that were 1. Natural fiber (bamboo, tencel, cotton, modal, viscose, rayon, etc), 2. Came in plus sizes, 3. Had decent reviews, and 4. Didn't cost a small fortune. Separation and lift would have been great, but I haven't found that yet. I also did all the sizing research. Did you know that you're supposed to add 4 inches to your under breast measurement to get your band size (in some brands)? I need bras that don't dig, so the last few bras I got were 44 bands or 3XL size - I thought since my old bras were 42, my ribcage must be 42, and a 44 should be extra, right? And a 3XL is typically 22-24 women's plus size (and works perfect or is slightly baggy in tops and dresses on me), so...? WRONG. So, I came to the conclusion that for comfort, I need a bra with at least a 48 inch band. And this is my first arrival of 2 types I ordered. :)

For reference: I am 5' 7"", 250 lbs, 47 years old and have an apple shaped body - big in the middle/stomach, narrow hips and shoulders, average size arms, legs, and thin/skinny/narrow hands and feet. My rib cage protrudes a lot more under my breasts than the average person. I don't know why, but my theory is that since I've had chronic severe asthma since I was a newborn, maybe the struggle to breathe made them grow or set weird? But because of that, my breasts sit right on top of my ribs, and always have. Longline bras, or bras with a wide band are a huge no go, because first they dig in painfully, and then they roll or fold up and cause even more pressure pain and irritation of the skin under my breasts.

This bra is stretchy enough to conform to my body, but still offers some support. It's thin cotton, that's moderately soft. I haven't had any issue with the shoulder straps being too long or too short, but they aren't adjustable... for me they're staying put and not slipping, and not digging in either. The band is comfortable so far, and I'd guess it's 1/2 - 3/4 inch wide. There are 8 hooks on mine, which is a LOT... probably overkill for my needs, but having the front closure is a bonus. I don't need to be contorting my body to get it on or off, or clasping in the front and then having to twist it around to the back to put it on right. The back feels supportive and like it's staying in place, and almost feels like I'm wearing a snug (not tight) tank top, in a nice way! It's got a scoop neck shape to it on the front and back, but on me (because I don't have huge breasts anymore), the top edge sits a bit high for most of my clothes. 90% of my tops and dresses are V necks or wrap styles, so I won't be able to wear this bra with those. But for errands, or lounging around the house, and even sleep, it's near perfect! I do get a small amount of separation, but nothing close to a molded or soft cup, underwire or wrap/crisscross bra would provide. The best part is that I have no sticky, icky, stinky, gross, itchy, burning under breast stuff going on at all today! That's worth the small price I paid for 2 bras any day!

I'm guessing time will tell how it goes in the long run with this bra. I'm guessing once it's hot and/or humid and I'm outside, the cotton would probably soak up my sweat and get soggy pretty quickly. I'm thinking over time it may stretch out with wear, maybe warp in the wash (which happens with cheap clothing, even if you do wash on gentle, with cold water and hang dry things), but I won't know for a while. I did notice a couple of tiny scratchy bits around the bottom band at the seams, but don't think I can do anything about it. It seems to be the thread they sewed it with was stiffer, synthetic and either cut off bluntly and not flush OR melted at the ends? Hopefully it goes away after a wash.",62,4,TRUE

-great weight for most seasons (little heavy for summer in the south). Fully lined and has full pockets!!!! Very slimming, fabric isn't cheap feeling, shoulder pads are low profile- just enough. Hits right at my hips, so it's the perfect length. Just enough stretch in the shoulders, too.
Cons-
- arrived really wrinkled and it's a little expensive. Sleeves are about 2 inches too long ( I have average length arms).

This bra is indeed comfortable. The material is soft, particularly inside the cups. I feel slightly deceived, however.

The main description-""SHAPERMINT Compression Wirefree High Support Bra for Women Small to Plus Size Everyday Wear, Exercise and Offers Back Support"". The packaging says nothing about compression or high support. That is what I was looking for and expecting. The brand name ""truekind"" is all over the packaging and material inside the bag. Shapermint is just on a little sticker on the bag. This is confusing.

For me, this is a leisure bra. Something I will only wear at home. If offers NO support whatsoever. Just some shaping, and a step above being braless. I didn't need another one of these. There is no back support, though I'm not even sure what that is supposed to be. On the plus-size models pictured, it fits well. On myself like most wire-free bras, the band immediately rolls up in the front, and bunches up on the sides and back. I need to adjust regularly. I think it is just the way my fat gut is positioned that makes all bras roll up, so I can't fault this bra for that. The shoulder straps are NOT thick as described. They are fairly narrow and dig in a bit. They also roll up, actually.

Again, the material itself is very soft and comfortable. But I am disappointed that this bra is not at all ""compression"" or ""high support"". It's a leisure bra. This is supposed to be suitable for plus sizes, but I think it may be better suited for smaller breasted, average size women.",1105,3,TRUE

I’d been looking to switch to a more minimalistic style of wallet for some time and today was the day. I ordered the Carbon Fiber style at 10pm-ish last night and it arrived at 5am this morning. That still amazes me how quick that can happen (I’m from the times when ""3 to 6 days"" was fast and when Amazon promised 2 day deliveries years ago I was one of the doubters. Absolutely incredible). Product arrived fast and perfectly packaged. Slim, professional but secure packaging opened into a sharp looking wallet. The wallet appears to be made of plastic, but isn’t cheap feeling. I wouldn’t be worried this was going to fall apart or break easily. I picked 5 cards to place into my new wallet and slid them in. The cards are very secure. To get any one card out you will have to focus intently on maneuvering the cards out, which is exactly what this is designed for. You won’t accidentally lose a card. There is a finger slit where you can place your most needed cards on the top and bottom (so your 2 most used) to allow for easier access. After practicing with 5 cards I added an additional 3 and saw no difference- still secure, still the same. In my mind adding any more would defeat the point of minimalistic, but if anyone is interested in more than 8 the wallet certainly seems capable of handling it.

The price seems fitting for what you get. Based on some of the reviews I've seen, this is a solid vendor with good customer service, which is re-assuring for those occasional times where a dud gets sent out or theres issues with the product fron packaging/shipping. Ive only had it a day, but so far I am happy with the purchase and would buy again. My only concern with this style of wallet is the cards rubbing against each other so much that it removes ink/print of the cards. I’ve had this happen even with bi-fold wallets, and this style would likely have more friction. We will see over time, but so far this style is much more convenient for someone like me.

This is Casio's way of building an even more prosperous, richly rewarding world.",4.6,18309,onwa,AHPXFXHUDJJK7D37RAE2VGLPRTDQ,"Bought this 2 years and 8 months ago and it's still great. In that time, it's drifted 27 seconds (e.g. at 8:00:00 it now reads 8:00:27). **EDIT** This drift is inaccurate. Updated at bottom of review **END EDIT**. For me, that's not a big deal, but figured I'd mention it. I wear the watch face-side down on my wrist, but it only accrued one mild scratch in all that time. Nothing terrible. I bought this watch because it had 3 things; the 24-hour time, the day of the week, and the date on a single screen. It's the only watch I've found that had all 3 of those. To find all 3 in a highly rated and CHEAP watch? I bought it in a second and haven't regretted it since. I actually returned a better and more expensive watch (Casio DW5600E-1V) before eventually finding and loving this. I especially love that it orders the date in Year-Month-Day format. I live in the US where Month-Day-Year is the norm, but I also work with thousands of computer files where the best way to organize files by date is with a Year-Month-Day system (e.g. 221102 for November 2, 2022). It's just a little nothing thing, but I love this watch for it.

I should note that the watch band snapped off back in August, 2 years and 5 months after getting the watch. That's happened with other watches with resin bands that I've owned, always around the 2-3 year mark. I heard it's from sweat or showers hardening the resin or something. That could make sense as I never take mine off except when I'm rock climbing. Regardless, I just grabbed a cheap 18mm silicone watch strap for 12.99 and it's been fine ever since (bought silicone because I heard they don't snap. I'll update this if it ever does).

I plan to use this watch forever. If it breaks, I'll buy a new one for the price of a burger + onion rings. I've gone through a dozen watches over the past 25 years or so, but this is the first one that I loved. It has everything I want without a bunch of other useless expensive crap that I'll never use (looking at you, altimeter; and that's coming from a hiker). It's cheap, reliable (anecdotally), has a fast band replacement process, no feature-bloat, has large text, and is DECENTLY water resistant. The only downside is that the watch isn't 200m water resistant. If it was, it'd be perfect for me. Anyway, I don't go surfing/swimming with it, but it hasn't fogged up after 2+ years of showers, rain, sweat, etc. If you want a cheap watch, I recommend this one (unless you're an avid surfer). Or if you're like me and willing to fork over $100 for a watch, maybe buy this anyway. It's certainly much better than the $21 price-tag would have you believe.

**EDIT** 12/12/23
I made the above review over a year ago, but I realized that I couldn't verify that the 27 seconds of drift was accurate. Well, I decided to run a little experiment over the past year and record the drift every few months (basically whenever I remembered I was even doing this) and it turns out that the drift WASN'T accurate. After a year, my watch drifted 58 seconds. To get that 27 second value, I might have reset my watch whenever we had daylight saving time or something, hence the inaccurate drift. Anyway, I included the recorded values below (MM/DD/YY format) in case someone is interested. Also, I used time.gov for the baseline comparison.

12/11/22 9:55PM - 0 seconds fast
01/19/23 6:18PM - 5 seconds fast
02/22/23 12:48PM - 10.5 seconds fast
04/15/23 9:00PM - 18.5 seconds fast
05/08/23 8:22PM - 22 seconds fast
06/27/23 12:52PM - 30 seconds fast
09/06/23 8:15PM - 41 seconds fast
11/05/23 7:18PM - 51 seconds fast
12/11/23 9:55PM - 58 seconds fast

This basically means my watch drifts by a little more than 1 second every week (1sec/~6.29days). For my needs, that's fine. I'm not doing anything in my daily life that requires long-term precision to the second, and I have to reset it every so often anyway for the aforementioned daylight saving time, so I don't mind at all. Other than that, the watch still works great (nearing 4 years now) and the ""new"" silicone watchband is still great too (although it hasn't hit that 2-3 year breakdown point yet). So, all in all, still happy with it.

",4.6,150, Chelsey D,AHGTOPHNA74TBDR3EIESFCQ4GC6Q,"First thing that drew me in about these shoes was the color. I love fun colors for running shoes, so these met that requirement for me. I’ve never had Mizuno shoes for running before so I was a little uncertain how I’d like them. (I usually buy ASICS, Saucony or New Balance.) I read a lot of online reviews that were mostly positive all around for Mizuno running shoes, so I decided to give them a shot. I’ve taken them out for a few runs now and so far so good! They’re comfortable and fun. I’ve read many reviews of people saying these shoes run small. That is NOT my opinion at all! I bought my normal shoe size and they fit like every running shoe I’ve ever had in that same size, so no issues with sizing for me at all. Width is a standard medium width as well; they don’t feel narrow to me. The other thing I was looking for in a pair of running shoes is a durable outsole. I do not know why, but it seems all running shoe brands are switching to a foam sole with a very thin lining of rubber. Those foam soles do not last long at all! The rubber on those wears out so quickly which is ridiculous when you’re spending $150+ on a shoe! Now, These Mizuno’s have a “normal” standard sole with a thicker rubber lining that will take a long time / many miles to wear down. They’re like the running shoe soles that all companies used to have. I wear my running shoes into the ground and really get my use out of them, so with these Mizuno soles, I’ll certainly be getting my money’s worth!

Long story short, these shoes run true to size, are comfortable and they have a durable outsole that is bound to last for quite a long time. It’s the first time I’ve tried Mizuno running shoes, but I’m guessing it will not be my last! No regrets with my purchase.",13,5,TRUE

I was pleasantly surprised with this purchase! I bought my regular size and they are just a tad loose, but nothing to complain about.
I did not have time to wear them before my holiday but they were nothing but comfortable from day 1.
I find myself grabbing for these shoes more often then not so that says a lot. I have had no shoe construction issues. I tend to wash my shoes in a garment bag in the washer, and then air dry, however, I have not done that yet.

The only thing I can advise for anyone who's not familiar with this fabric is to be mindful of washing and drying. When I pulled them out of the dryer, they looked like they had shrunk about a 2"" (5 cm). I totally forgot I put them in there! However, I got out my trusty garment steamer again and lightly pulled vertically while steaming, which put them right about where they were before. All good!

In sum, either get a garment steamer, iron, or air dry them after washing. They are my favorite pair of summer pants and go with lots of tops while covering you up, and being light and flowy :)",15,5,TRUE

",AF5GV6IFECY67I5FYVDBO3MZFHRA,"I will start off with saying, I have wide feet, I work in a restaurant inside a museum and I’m on my feet in and out of the kitchen, dinning room, up and down stairs and just walking around a big museum 8-10 hours a day. These shoes have been great and I’ve only had them less than a week. There was no breaking in period and even the regular size was perfect for my wide feet. I got a size 10 and I’m a pretty solid size 10 sometimes 11 if they are narrow or run small, but these are fit well. They are a little on the large size so if you are in between sizes or like a tighter fit I would down size by 1/2. My feet aren’t sliding around or popping out, and they aren’t rubbing or causing blisters. I think the small amount of extra room is perfect for when my feet swell a bit by the end of the shift. Also they grip well on wet floors so I’m not sliding all over the kitchen. I’ve bought $80-$100 shoes that claim to be made specifically for servers and the like and these have been far more comfy and functional than any of those fancy sneakers. I don’t know how long they will last, but for $30 bucks if they last me 6 months they will be worth it.",21,5,TRUE

After wearing it one time the pilling on the sleeves where your arms brush up against your torso is insane. Too bad the fabric isn’t a better quality. Otherwise, I would have given it a 5 star review since it was exactly what I was looking for. Initially, I ordered the coral color, but found that it looked different from the photos online and was less of a pink/rose color, and definitely more of a coral/orange. Didn’t work with my skin tone. Exchanged it for tan that was more versatile for my needs. It definitely runs large. I like my sweaters and outerwear to have extra room and be a little baggy, but I found that a medium was definitely baggy enough on me. I’m 5’10”.

The soles did end up cracking but I washed them a bunch of times and I was not too easy on them. I’m back to buy another pair!!! That’s how great these fit and look!

After reading the reviews about these running large I ordered the 8.5, my usual size... They are perfect. I wore them all day and night the first time and no problems what so ever. No pain, blisters, or soreness. These are comparable to vans but half the price and more comfortable at least to me... I have medium to high arches and my feet are not narrow nor real wide, but they do swell since I'm 38 and sit at a desk all day... These seem like they'd adjust to a lot of different shaped feet because the canvas is flexible.

Since the sizes available are a little different, if available, get a Half size smaller than your normal, especially if you have reg width to narrow feet.

These are great for people who do not have consistent length toes. (Because of the tiny bit extra room in the toe box). I'll buy again and again because I'm hard on shoes and with this price, fit, style and many colors I'll be a happy customer for a while. And see myself buying the white ones each spring!

If using these for a trip definitely give them a few days to break in. They are a very soft faux leather, so it doesn’t take long to break them in for your feet, but you’ll appreciate getting used to the little parts that may rub your ankles differently.

I am an insole girly through and through- I have plantar fasciitis and a mildly irritated sciatic so even walking around my house barefoot is painful. I need insoles in ALL my shoes, even slippers. I didn’t for these! They have an amazing amount of support that molds to your feet over time.

They have a bit of a platform, not so much that you feel like you’re dragging around the platform sandals of the 90’s, but enough that I couldn’t even feel the cobblestone tiles.

Even though there are different colors I liked the white shoes they best, but was also very scared to buy my first all white shoes for such a walking-heavy trip. Don’t be scared. The material is water resistant which apparently also makes them a bit dirt resistant. By the end of the trip I just had to wipe off the dust from the body of the shoes with a dry rag and use a magic eraser on the soles of the shoes and they look good as new.

The grip is also wildly impressive, we were walking on slick tiles for multiple drizzly days and I didn’t slip once.

Bonus: They look cute!

The only downside for me is that they don’t breathe super well, so your feet may get a little toasty by the end of the day. Also for that reason it might be a good idea to spray them with some deodorizer just in case they get a little stinky. But honestly, having hot feet at the end of a long day was SO much better than major foot and back pain after walking all over Portugal!",172,5,TRUE

1. The fabric is kind of heavy and coarse, which isn’t a deal breaker since I generally wear long shorts under my skirts. But if rough texture is a big one for you it may not be a good fit as this hasn’t softened up much after a few washes. Also since the fabric is heavy and not that breathable it can also get a bit hot inside the skirt if your moving around a lot.

2. The waistband is also a bit tight like the large skirt fit but the waist can dig at times. After a few washes the elastic started to twist and deform. I cut it out and used a black drawstring from old shorts and find this way more comfortable.",13,3,TRUE

",4.4,3824,Janene S.,AHAXULD2RKDXXVTX45T7T7H45OXQ,"Before a recent trip to Europe, I spent a lot of time researching shoes online. I wanted something cute and didn’t want to spend the week in my running shoes, and I knew my Converse weren’t going to hold up to a lot of walking. After reading the reviews for these I decided to give them a try and they did not disappoint. I didn’t break them in, just threw them in my suitcase and hoped for the best. They held up beautifully, were cushy and comfortable for miles and miles of walking (I got anywhere from 10,000 to 20,000 steps per day on our trip), no achy feet, no blisters, and the one thing I didn’t have to worry about the whole trip was my feet. My only caveat is that because they’re “pleather,” they are not very breathable, so my feet were pretty stinky at the end of the day – small price to pay for how well they took care of my feet otherwise. Regarding sizing, I did struggle to find the right size at first. My usual shoe size for work shoes (ankle boots) and everyday tennis shoes (Converse) is a size 7, wide if I can find it. My running shoe size is a 7.5 wide. Based on reviews I ordered a 7 first, which was a little snug. I returned it for a 7.5, which felt a lot better, and the lack of wide sizing didn’t seem to be an issue for my feet. I would also note that even with lots of walking and bike riding (which involved frequently using the top of my shoe to push the bike pedal back up so I could push off), they didn’t get as scuffed up as I thought they would, and after a week they still looked brand new. I expect they’ll be easy to clean with a baby wipe or magic eraser. These will definitely be my go-to vacation shoes!",134,5,TRUE

So many summer shirts the armholes are so big that you can see in to them and see bra or need to wear another shirt underneath such as a cami which I don't want to do as it is summer and hot. The mint green shirt is very pretty but the sheerness of fabric is more than the blue but have to assume due to simply color as they feel exactly the same.

I was nervous that they wouldnt fit my feet given the reviews and even considered buying two sizes/sizing up - I'm glad I didnt. I am a size 8, but sometimes wear a 7.5 in larger shoes i.e. Merrells. In New Balances, I can wear either a 7.5 or 8 usually. I wear an 8 in tevas/old navy flip flops. This shoe is definitely narrow, but I have narrow feet! I actually tried an 8.5 on in person to see if I should size up and let me tell you - I had clown feet. The 8.5 was creepily long on me. So I ordered the size 8 here and they fit perfectly! They're the perfect length for my feet and I actually have a little bit of wiggle room around my ankles so they're easy to slip on and off w/out messing up i.e., crushing the back of the shoe or having to untie them. Longer shoe laces would be nice, but thats something I could get on my own. These shoes don't provide much arch support, but they're comfy for walking around and running errands/being on campus for the day. They do rub a little on the back ankle if you're wearing shorter socks so beware of that - I just wear ankle socks now.

But I really like the yellow color, it has protected me completely, and besides one spot on the sleeve it washed completely clean after I did masonry work in it for five days straight. It does dry quickly. So quickly I don’t put it in the dryer, I just hang it beside the dryer while everything else dries and it’s pretty much dry when that’s done. I wear a women’s size 8-10 petite. I have this shirt in a medium (the yellow pictures) and a white size 1X (bc it was discounted to $15 and I know how to sew).

1. getting the LONG not only made the length of the pants leg longer, it also made the rise of the pant longer. The fit was so much better in the Long vs. the regular length that it is worth the extra trouble of having to hem them.
2. The fabric, not just the color, varies from color to color. The ""black"" is NOT black denim; it is truly a stretchy but very professional and/or dressy looking pair of black slacks. On the other hand, the indigo rinse and the carbon rinse look and feel like denim with a great amount of stretch in the heavyweight fabric. SUPER flattering.",31 people found this helpful,4.2,TRUE

There was enough room in the waist for me to sit comfortably, but they didn’t fall below my belly button when standing. I wore heels with these, and they fell just below my ankles… JUST long enough for someone my height to wear heels with in a size small.

So I was thrilled to find these Hanes ones-- really, same thing.
I bought white, navy, the bright blue, in size L, because Hanes doesn't do Tall sizes like ON.
I am 5'9"" 145 36-30-40, and hate tight things, so these are a little looser than my MT's, but that's OK, amazingly they are same length as my MT from ON. .I'm afraid a M in this brand might be too short. Sleeves are long, too, which is great for me.

The white is thinner and more slub than all but the very last pic of the model indicate. I included a backlit shot so you can see. Doesn't bother me, but the white WILL show your bra/shirt (whatever you wear under it), and anything in the pocket( see full length pic with fingers). Same as the light ON's.

The colored versions aren't as transparent.

The white photos are the Hanes, the yellow is the Old Navy MT.

If you like Hoodies, these are great for summer. If you are larger, or want a bigger/longer sweatshirt and are tall, the JMS is the plus brand version and comes in many of same colors.

",4.5,"10,921",photogirlla,AELZXI323VKX354DYB35REGUSPHA,"I bought the caramel color in an XL because I like things loose. it hits my lower hip and is fairly straight shaped, sleeves are a good length for my 5’9” 145 lb.

The sweater is all cotton, is lightweight and not scratchy, but seems fairly warm, at least for California winter days. The caramel color is not see through; I suspect the light colors might be a little, as I also tried white, and you could see my black bra through it. I am returning that white one, and exchanging it for a dark red; nice that Amazon does that.

I don’t know if I would call this color caramel, it’s more of a rust orange. The pictures I posted are in a turquoise room, both in and out of direct sunlight, so you can get an idea of the color.

But for the price point, a nice sweater. Size down if you want a fitted look, the sweater does tend to run a little wide. I would take a medium if I wanted it to actually fit correctly, but then the sleeves might be too short.

Edit: I also bought the dark red in an XL, see pictures. It is not a dark red; I would say it’s more of a dark rose/slightly rust in some light. The dark red was shot in overcast rainy light

Edit 2: Bought navy and sage green. Navy is same length as dark red and caramel, but the sage green is like a medium, short and tight, with shorter sleeves. Tag says xl so either mislabeled or quality control issue. Green is also duller and less aqua than pictured on models. Back it goes.",25,5,TRUE

I wasn't expecting much considering the brand and price so I wasn't very disappointed when they arrived and the quality seemed so-so. I was mostly looking for a lightweight jacket to throw over leggings and a t-shirt for quick errands or to wear for yard work/gardening without being too hot but getting some cover from the sun too. I think I got what I wanted though I'd warn these are extremely thin and I doubt they will hold up for very long. I read they were t-shirt material but I think that's an overstatement. If I bought a t-shirt as thin as this I'd return it immediately because it would be see through. The white jacket is see through. I was wearing a navy tank top when I tried it on and you see the dark color very clearly through the jacket, I'd only wear the white with a pale shirt underneath otherwise it looks cheap. I had a fair amount of loose strings on the jacket and several hanging off the seams that I either tied off or trimmed. Amazon recommended a large but I ordered an x-lrg thinking I'd like it looser for working outside or casual errands. If I had to order again I would of just gone with the large, I think they run a size up based on how it fits, but I'm not exchanging them as they'll work fine for my intended purposes. Lastly, these are very long jackets. If you're average height looking to cover your tush, these will work very well.

",4.2,"8,408",fellow,AHAWLQW32273BG47HUM5J2J5EXYQ,"This was one of the few pants that actually fit me correctly in the waist and hips. I did have to take up the hem, but that is pretty common for me. I ended up buying 3 pairs in different colors a few months ago, happy with the fit and knowing that no size alteration was needed. It was great!

I needed to buy a few more for work and received them recently. But something is different. The material doesn't feel the same - almost a bit cheaper and more stretchy. The fit was too big in the waist. I ordered the same size as the previous pairs so it shouldn't have been an issue. And based on the measurements, going down a size would have been tight.

What happened? Why did these change so much? It's disappointing to say the least and I don't have time to send these back to try and find another pair that will fit better. So I had to take them apart at the waist and do some alterations I wasn't expecting. I appreciate the width of the leg and that they are, for the most part, easy to alter on your own. But these are not the pants I bought a few months ago. :(

I also found one of the bags with some kind of liquid in it. Not sure I want to know what it was. I washed the pants immediately and disposed of the bag. I did not want an unknown substances transfer to my skin. Gross.",11,4.2,TRUE

I'm very tall and all torso, and it hits right at the top of my hip bones. The best part though is that it's a very functional denim jacket. Warm enough to wear as a jacket, but breathable enough to wear as part of an outfit. If I had any complaint, it's that the pocket openings seem to sit very far back, almost at the side seams.

For easy access, of course. Over the next 6 days and 90 miles I never had sweat in my eyes again. My face had sweat, of course, but it was not from my noggin running down into my eyes along the way.

JB",AFGBJNAI4YVZSAD5HI3UJJYBQYCA,"So I agonized over the decision to buy these for at least a week...maybe two. In the end I ordered the mock tortoise Clubmasters which have the 49mm bridge, and I am thrilled with what I got. I was worried about the following:

Q. Would they fit my face? Could I pull off the style? A. They fit perfectly. I have a small head (hold the sophomoric comments) which measures 7 1/8, and I was afraid these would be too big for my face from the pictures I saw. In fact, they fit my face exactly as I would have hoped. They look neither too big nor too small. As for the style, they're classics. They don't fit your face...your face fits them. It just happens. I can't imagine anyone not looking great in these.

Q. Do they have the G15 lens, and should I insist on polarized? A. These do have the G15 lens, which Ray-Ban calls a green tint lens. I wasn't sure what I would get because the description doesn't call it out specifically, and the pictures certainly look like a black lens. The optics in the Clubmasters are insanely clear. You see a slightly greenish tint from the inside out, and the rest of the world sees black from the outside in. Looking at these lenses, I can immediately spot the difference between an over $100 and an under $100 pair of glasses. The green tint is quite subtle, and is hardly noticeable. Also, they are not polarized, which I think is a good thing. I have a pair of $15 polarized Wally World specials, and I use those for outdoor activities which are potentially dangerous for my Clubmasters.

Q. Will I get a pair made in China? Will those be knock-offs? A. My pair unabashedly says ""Made In China,"" and the quality is stunning. They are well-built, all the connections are tight, and both lenses sit tightly in the frames (no issues with a loose lens as others have commented on here). Anyone who has done just a little bit of research on these knows that the Clubmasters are now made in China instead of (or in addition to) Italy. China is like any other country: with the right management and workforce, they can churn out some good stuff. And apparently Ray-Ban has some great ex-pats running their factories, 'cause these are rock solid. I would absolutely buy another style of Ray-Bans made in China. They are that good. I looked at these under a microscope (metaphorically speaking) for all the tell-tale signs of counterfeit, but I was just wasting my time; these are the real deal. I'm 34 years old, and these are the first sunglasses that I have owned that cost more than $20. You bet I looked them over real good.

Other thoughts: I'm used to curved sport sunglasses which sit nicely on top of your head when you head indoors. Sitting on your head will not do for the Clubmasters, due to their shape. It's awkward to go indoors, because the question is what do you do with your $150 sunglasses (that we smart folks on Amazon paid $50 less for) so that you don't scratch them\lose them\break them? Don't know; haven't figured that one out yet.

The straw derby/panama hat craze is in full swing right now. Not my thing, but I seem to see them on everyone. These would look absolutely authentic and correct sitting just below a short-brimmed straw panama/derby. Classic, classic look.
