        "text": "These pants are highly comfortable and REALLY enjoyable to wear when I dress casually/formally and pairing with one of my sport coats or blazers. They are stretchy so you still have plenty of mobility. It's like wearing comfortable slim jeans disguised as casual pants (lol).\n\nFASHION ADVICE: I saw some other reviews of guys talking about \"too long for 6ft and 31in inseam\" but looking at the pictures that they've posted, the pants aren't even sitting at their waist (your waist is just under/at your belly button) They're wearing them like hip pants (many guys think the waist is the hip but it's not) but they are waist pants. The categories are (low hip/hip/Waist/High Waist). Trust me fellas, wearing your pants at your WAIST is very groomed. I know y'all are imagining a nerdy cartoon caricature that has on \"high water(high waist)\" pants but that's not what waist pants are. They give you an even distribution of the upper body and extends your legs in appearance. For my fellas with a gut, it disguises your belly, giving you a slimmer look than when you wear it at the hip and your fat is hanging off the waistline, giving you a sloppier look.",

These socks provide exceptional comfort with their well-designed cushioning, particularly in the arch area, making long hikes and outdoor activities far more enjoyable. Even in cooler weather, the wool blend in these socks keeps my feet warm without causing overheating, striking a perfect balance between insulation and breathability. Moreover, their durability is impressive; they've proven to be exceptionally resilient even with regular use and washing, showing no signs of wear or thinning. Additionally, these socks stay in place during hikes, ensuring that they don't slide down or bunch up, which is essential for preventing blisters and discomfort. Their unisex design is also convenient, making them suitable for both men and women. While they may be on the pricier side compared to other hiking socks, the quality and performance they deliver make them a worthwhile investment for outdoor enthusiasts. If you enjoy spending time outdoors, I highly recommend giving these Merrell hiking socks a try\u2014they might just become your go-to choice for your outdoor adventures.",

Just a very good weight to it.\n- The length is also perfect for someone around my height.\nNot too short or too long (I took a picture with my arm raised so you can see where it lands).\n- The sleeve width is just how I like it where it hugs the arm but doesn't restrict any movement especially when I pull the sleeve up (since it's cotton, it's gonna stretch anyway until you wash/dry it) and doesn't have too much fabric hanging when I bend over or crouch down which is what I often look for (some brands just have too much and makes you look like a sloppy bum).\n- The underarm has enough room to not rub your armpit when moving around either (rashes are no bueno).\n\nJust know that since it's cotton, it might shrink up a whole lot after drying but if you do it on a low setting or hang it up right after, it should be fine.\nAll in all, I just know what to expect from the Amazon brand and they are always an awesome value for the price. I had to knock a star off for the buttons being misaligned but I let them know and they sent me a replacement for free which is something I've never had to do.\n\nI took a few pictures just to help you out with making a great decision! :D",

        "text": "I have bought the 8 inch Nortiv 8 boots before and they were very comfortable. These 6 inch Nortiv 8 boots are less comfortable mostly because the shaft is shorter.\n\nBecause the shaft is shorter, the opening is narrower and makes it harder to get my foot into the boot The 8 inch boot opens wider (probably because the shaft is taller) and the shaft acts as a shoe horn to help guide my foot into the boot.\n\nBecause the shaft is shorter, the collar rubs against my leg above the ankle as I walk. A little bit more padding on the collars of these boots would have fixed the problem. The collar of the 8 inch shaft sits higher on my calf and does not move much relative to my leg as I walk.\n\nOther than these shortcomings, the 6 inch boots are as comfortable as the 8 inch boots and require little break in. These boots have a lot of grip (on dry pavement) so be careful to not make sudden turns so as not to twist your ankles.\n\nAnother minor issue is the way the boots were packaged. They arrived with the laces going from the outside through the eyelets to the inside (see pictures). To tie the boots, I have to first pull the laces out of the top eyelets. (I do not know how to tie the boots from the inside, fcol.) The problem is there are eyelets on the outside of the boots, but only holes on the inside. This makes the hard ends of the laces difficult to line up with the eyelets and be pulled through. This took quite a bit of effort as I didn't want to damage the laces in case I have to return these boots. I wish Nortiv 8 would just lace these boots ready to be used than to make them look good. This would not be a problem if you wear your boots like the models with the ends of the laces tucked inside your boots!!",

Just a very good weight to it.\n- The length is also perfect for someone around my height.\nNot too short or too long (I took a picture with my arm raised so you can see where it lands).\n- The sleeve width is just how I like it where it hugs the arm but doesn't restrict any movement especially when I pull the sleeve up (since it's cotton, it's gonna stretch anyway until you wash/dry it) and doesn't have too much fabric hanging when I bend over or crouch down which is what I often look for (some brands just have too much and makes you look like a sloppy bum).\n- The underarm has enough room to not rub your armpit when moving around either (rashes are no bueno).\n\nJust know that since it's cotton, it might shrink up a whole lot after drying but if you do it on a low setting or hang it up right after, it should be fine.\nAll in all, I just know what to expect from the Amazon brand and they are always an awesome value for the price. I had to knock a star off for the buttons being misaligned but I let them know and they sent me a replacement for free which is something I've never had to do.\n\nI took a few pictures just to help you out with making a great decision! :D",

Comparable hoodies from other sellers are nearly twice the price, and are of lower quality in my opinion.\n\nFits perfectly for a slim/athletic build. Cuffs are nice and snug, and the cut through the chest and waist is slim enough to be flattering, but not so tight that you look like a bozo.\n\nMaterial is very soft, and lightweight. Good enough for layering, but don\u2019t expect it to keep you warm in severe cold. I\u2019ve only had them for a couple/few weeks, so I can\u2019t comment on the durability.\n\nIt\u2019s great that they come in nearly every color imaginable, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any inventory shortages. Colors are pretty true to the pictures, though I\u2019d say the green looks a little brighter/paler in the picture relative to the actual hoodie, which is a slightly darker green. The other three colors I have are spot on.\n\nThanks! Been looking for a good hoodie, and the others I\u2019ve tried have disappointed.",

It's way too big and when you pull the shirt up to get the collar to fit where a normal shirt would fit you get the infamous \"bacon collar\". Overall I can't wear these at work and they'll have to be used for working out. Pretty disappointed considering the good parts. If I could return them all I would.",

Well it does fit me just fine, but I am a tall person with a shorter torso. If you have a long torso this jumper may give you issues! A hand washed it and it still fits very nicely. It's so comfortable and breezy. So I ordered one in one of the patchwork colors, same size xxl. Xxl. However, it did not fit the same and it was about an inch and a half shorter than the gray one, even when the gray one was already washed and air-dried. I also noticed that the patchwork one was slightly different in the styling. The back had a gather in it at the top. I might have kept it if it fit. Just a little bit better. But I am sending the patchwork colored jumper back. All in all I would recommend this and if you really like it and it doesn't fit, maybe try a different color or pattern because the one I got and that fits is wonderful. Will get a lot of wear this summer \ud83d\ude42",

        "text": "I bought these 16mos ago and was instantly very happy with them. The memory foam and faux fleece lining felt very good on the feet. The fit was right, and the slippers were very warm. In the packaging there was a card that said something to the effect of \u201cPlease don\u2019t return these slippers if they fit snuggly, wear them for a few days and the insides will matt down a bit and then they should fit true to size.\u201d I found this to be exactly the case and after a few wears the slippers fit perfectly, felt great, and kept my feet feel snug as a bug in a rug.\n\nHowever it\u2019s not been 16 mos and the slippers are falling off of my feet! Clearly my feet didn\u2019t shrink which leaves me to conclude that the matting down process that they allude to on that aforementioned card does not stop after a few days. I think what actually happened is that after a time the memory foam begins to break down and deteriorate. In any case it\u2019s been 16mos and I can no longer wear these slippers.\n\nThese slippers cost roughly 25%-50% more than most of the others I looked at, and for that cost I rather expect a longer life than 16mos. While these aren\u2019t a bad slipper at their price point the math simply isn\u2019t \u201cmathing.\u201d I know I could buy a pair of slippers at 2/3 the price and get the same longevity out of them as I\u2019ve done it in the past.\n\nOverall, a decent slipper so I\u2019m giving 4 stars, but deducting one star because I think that for the money they should go with a batter memory foam that doesn\u2019t deteriorate so quickly.",

This 6-pack of classic white crew undershirts is a staple in my wardrobe now, and here's why:\n\nMaterial and Build Quality: Made from 100% cotton, these shirts are soft and breathable. The fabric feels high-quality and doesn't thin out after several washes. The seams on the neck and shoulders are covered softly, ensuring no irritation or chafing, which is a significant plus for me.\n\nFit and Comfort: The classic fit allows for a full range of movement without restriction. True to their name, they stay tucked in all day long without bunching up, which is great whether you're wearing them under a dress shirt for work or under a flannel for a casual outing. The lay flat collar remains neat and crisp, enhancing the overall look.\n\nMoisture Management: These shirts do a fantastic job of wicking away moisture, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout the day, whether I'm in a meeting or getting things done around the house.\n\nCare Instructions: They are easy to care for\u2014machine wash warm on a gentle cycle and tumble dry low. I've followed these instructions and have seen minimal shrinkage and no loss of color or quality.\n\nSustainability: I appreciate that these shirts are made with safer chemicals and have sustainability certifications like OEKO-TEX STANDARD 100. It's reassuring to know I\u2019m wearing something that's friendlier to the environment.\n\nValue for Money: Considering the durability, comfort, and quality, these undershirts offer great value, especially in a 6-pack. They hold up well over time, making the investment worthwhile.\n\nCustomer Sentiment: Echoing other customers, I find these shirts exceptionally comfortable, well-fitting, and of high quality. Though some have noted issues with shrinkage and consistency in thickness, my experience has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nIn summary, if you're looking for reliable, comfortable, and sustainable undershirts that won't break the bank, the Fruit of the Loom Men's Eversoft Cotton Stay Tucked Crew T-Shirts are an excellent choice. They meet all my needs for an everyday essential.",

        "text": "I've bought two sets of these boxer briefs and they are excellent overall, especially for the price. I've worn ExOfficio and Duluth Trading Co. long boxer briefs before, and while those brands make an excellent product, one pair costs twice what a pack of four of these babies does. They are lightweight, comfortable, don't ride up or twist, and silky to the touch which is also kinda nice for putting on the pants. They slide right over with little resistance. I haven't had them long enough to know about long-term durability, but I've probably had them for 3-6 months and they're holding up well so far.\n\nMy only complaint was that the sizing seems a bit off. The first set I got was a medium (my normal size). They fit nicely in the waist and legs, but really end up tucking my fishing tackle up into an uncomfortable position. I'm not trying to walk around with nut huggers on. So for my next set I sized up to large, but I was worried they would be too big in the waist and legs. Not so! The large fits perfectly. I'd just recommend buying one size up from your normal size unless you like your junk crushed up tightly against the taint.\n\nUpdate: as for long term durability, they could be better. In several pairs, the back of the waistband elastic has done that thing where it gets all loose and wavey. However, I think this is mainly due to drying them. I try not to dry them in a dryer but hang to dry and that seems to help them last longer. Still, for the price it\u2019s hard to go wrong.",

THEN I had my first baby, and in my post partum period, I searched for seamless leggings. I ordered these and 3 other brands of similar price. Instantly these were the winners. Even before trying them on, the material is SO soft, yet thick, and stretchy. You cannot see through them at all. The butt scrunch is SO flattering but not ridiculous to where I feel weird in public. They don\u2019t shrink or deteriorate in the wash, they have stayed just as soft as when I first got them. My favorite part about them is they don\u2019t slide down, and give you that webbed feeling in the crotch area where you have to keep hiking them up. They are like a second skin, but thick, pretty darn warm and comfortable enough to sleep in. Other brands I tried were itchy catching on leg hair, and the waist band stretched out after a few hours to where they slide down. Can you tell I could go on and on about these?! Also they have never once snagged or got a whole and I have been wearing them daily for over a year now.",

        "text": "I purchased these Champion (a Hanes brand) sweatpants in navy blue size large on 1/3/2021. I am 6' 2\", 185-lbs. with a 36\" waist. The sweatpants are a little tight around the waist since they're new and elastic is still fresh, and wearing them with the bottom edge of the elastic waist on my hips, the cuff edges are below the tops of my low-cut Chuck Taylors but don't drag on the ground. In other words, they fit fine. Their construction is as advertised: medium weight, non-ribbed cuff (see photo) with beefy waist drawstring on the INSIDE of the waistband (where it belongs, out of sight). The texture is smooth on the outside, as in the vendor photo, and moderately fleecy on the inside. There is a nifty multi-color hang loop on the inner waistband, too. I found no loose or broken threads, and no holes. These are similar to an ancient pair of Wilson poly-cotton sweats I have that are slightly heavier. I washed the new Champions in lukewarm water and they don't appear to have shrunken. Well worth the $22.26 including tax. I plan to buy another pair before their availability evaporates like so many other finely-made consumer goods that have disappeared (but I'm just geezing).",

FYI, I normally wear a 7 1/4 hat size and this cap fits me really well. The inside lining is very soft and the rolled outside cuff is plenty long enough to roll down in the back and cover my neck into my coat collar. Appears to quite well made.",

I contacted Under Armour support and they said since I did not buy it from ua.com they would not warranty it. I contacted Amazon and they stepped up and replaced the backpack. 5 Stars for Amazon support! Zero Stars for Under Armour for not supporting their product. I would not recommend buying any Under Armour product. Go to the Under Armour site and see if you can find any warranty information? I used to like the Under Armour product, but without a warranty it is garbage. Thanks again Amazon for the great support.",
